/**
 * Daily inventory scan trigger.
 *
 * The scan itself (low-stock / out-of-stock / expiry pass) lives server-side —
 * `runInventoryScan` in `src/server/inventory.ts` — but like auto-backup, this
 * app is serverless, so the "daily call" is orchestrated from the browser:
 * once per day (checked against a localStorage date), the app shell fires
 * POST /api/inventory/scan. The Inventory page's "Scan now" button and the
 * dashboard alert panel share the same endpoint and the same semantics —
 * open alerts are rebuilt to match the current stock state.
 *
 * Mirrors use-auto-backup's structure, so a real Cloudflare Cron trigger can
 * replace it later without touching the server logic.
