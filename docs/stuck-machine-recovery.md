# Stuck-machine audit & recovery runbook

*Audit date: 2026-10-04, after v1.4.19. Evidence-gathering commands are inline so
the audit can be re-run after future releases.*

## TL;DR — which machines can no longer update themselves

| Population | Versions | Why stuck | Data at risk? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows desktop** | v1.4.0 – v1.4.2 | No in-app updater existed yet (added in v1.4.3, commit `64533d9`) | No — reinstalling over the top preserves data |
| **Windows desktop** | v1.4.3 – v1.4.4 | Updater worked, but the service-worker shell cache never changed name, so after an in-app update the **UI stayed on the old version** while the binary moved on (`fa2e641`, fixed in v1.4.5). The updater sees a current binary and never offers anything again — the machine looks permanently stuck at the old version | No |
| **Android** | v1.4.6 – v1.4.14 | Each release's APK was signed with a **one-off ephemeral CI keystore** (fallback removed in `1980162`, v1.4.15). Certificates differ release-to-release (verified below), so Android refuses to install any newer APK over an existing one (`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`). Only way forward is uninstall → reinstall, which **wipes the app's private data** | **Yes — unless backed up first** |
| Android | ≤ v1.4.5 | n/a — those releases shipped unsigned APKs that Android rejects outright ("invalid"), so no installs of them can exist | — |
| **Desktop ≥ v1.4.3, Android ≥ v1.4.15** | current | Healthy: updater feed (`releases/latest/download/latest.json`) verified live → v1.4.19 with valid signatures; updater pubkey and endpoint unchanged since v1.4.3; Android signing key stable since v1.4.15 | — |

The rest of this document shows the evidence and the recovery runbooks.

## Evidence

### 1. When the updater shipped, and that its trust config never changed

```sh
git log --oneline --all -- src/client/lib/updater.ts        # first: 64533d9 (in v1.4.3)
git tag --contains 64533d9 | sort -V | head -3              # → v1.4.3
# pubkey + endpoint identical at 64533d9 and HEAD:
git show 64533d9:src-tauri/tauri.conf.json | grep -A3 '"endpoints"'
diff <(git show 64533d9:src-tauri/tauri.conf.json | grep pubkey) <(grep pubkey src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)
```

### 2. The updater feed is healthy right now

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/azshifat007/Dental-Canvas/releases/latest/download/latest.json
# → {"version":"1.4.19", "platforms":{...signed entries...}}
```

### 3. Android: the ephemeral-key era is real (certificates differ per release)

`scripts/extract-apk-cert.mjs` (committed with this doc) pulls the signer
certificate SHA-256 out of the APK Signing Block (v2/v3 scheme — `keytool
-printcert -jarfile` only reads the old v1 jar signatures and reports
"Not a signed jar file" for these APKs).

```sh
gh release download v1.4.6  --repo azshifat007/Dental-Canvas --pattern '*.apk' -O 6.apk
gh release download v1.4.14 --repo azshifat007/Dental-Canvas --pattern '*.apk' -O 14.apk
gh release download v1.4.15 --repo azshifat007/Dental-Canvas --pattern '*.apk' -O 15.apk
gh release download v1.4.19 --repo azshifat007/Dental-Canvas --pattern '*.apk' -O 19.apk
node scripts/extract-apk-cert.mjs 6.apk
node scripts/extract-apk-cert.mjs 14.apk
node scripts/extract-apk-cert.mjs 15.apk
node scripts/extract-apk-cert.mjs 19.apk
```

Measured fingerprints (2026-10-04):

| APK | Signer cert SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| v1.4.6 | `65:12:B5:F0:FD:3C:56:85:92:CE:0C:65:37:51:9C:37:D7:F0:FC:93:DD:39:A2:F5:FC:EE:74:F0:BC:18:12:7E` |
| v1.4.14 | `FD:13:59:C3:20:27:A7:BD:DB:0C:6A:AB:AB:74:58:04:8B:DD:74:DA:96:85:E5:46:5C:77:AE:75:56:2B:7F:76` |
| v1.4.15 | `53:27:4C:32:27:1E:FB:6C:C7:B3:9C:32:AD:7E:21:A0:FA:34:A7:36:01:A9:CA:35:81:22:B5:81:BF:6E:7D:4B` |
| v1.4.19 | `53:27:4C:32:27:1E:FB:6C:C7:B3:9C:32:AD:7E:21:A0:FA:34:A7:36:01:A9:CA:35:81:22:B5:81:BF:6E:7D:4B` |

v1.4.6 ≠ v1.4.14 → in-place updates were already broken **within** the
ephemeral era. v1.4.15 = v1.4.19 → the stable-keystore era
(`~/dental-canvas-signing/dental-canvas-release.jks`, wired as required CI
secrets by `1980162`) is continuous, so machines on ≥ v1.4.15 can sideload any
newer APK straight over the old one.

### 4. Why desktop reinstalls are safe but Android uninstalls are not

The entire database lives in the WebView's **IndexedDB** on every platform
(`src/server/offline/sqlite-adapter.ts` exports the whole DB image to IndexedDB
after each mutation batch).

- **Windows desktop**: IndexedDB belongs to the WebView2 *user data folder*
  (under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`), not the install directory. Running a newer
  `setup.exe` over an existing install replaces the binary but leaves the
  profile — and the data — untouched.
- **Android**: IndexedDB is inside the app's private sandbox. **Uninstalling
  the app deletes the database.** There is no way to change APK signatures
  without uninstalling. Hence: backup first, always.

## Recovery runbooks

### A. Windows desktop, stuck at ≤ v1.4.2 (no updater)

1. Download the current installer from the releases page:
   `https://github.com/azshifat007/Dental-Canvas/releases/latest` →
   `Dental.Canvas_<ver>_x64-setup.exe`.
2. Optional but recommended: Settings → Backup → export a backup file (or rely
   on the folder auto-backup if configured).
3. Run the installer. NSIS upgrades in place; the WebView2 profile ( IndexedDB
   database, settings) is preserved.
4. First launch of the new version shows the "updated" banner and the What's
   new page. Subsequent updates are automatic (hourly feed poll).

Note: installers are not code-signed, so SmartScreen shows "Windows protected
your PC" — More info → Run anyway.

### B. Windows desktop, "stuck" at v1.4.3/v1.4.4 (stale-UI bug)

Symptom: the app always shows an old version in Settings → About even though
the updater says everything is fine (the *binary* may already be much newer —
the UI is served from a frozen service-worker cache).

Recovery is the same as **A** (run the latest installer): the new build's
version-stamped shell cache (v1.4.5+) replaces the frozen one on first launch.
If the UI is *still* stale after reinstalling, clear the WebView cache:
delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<app-identifier>\EBWebView\Default\Service Worker\`
(or, simpler, Settings → Backup → export, then reinstall) — data in IndexedDB
is not affected by removing the service-worker cache itself.

### C. Android, on v1.4.6 – v1.4.14 (ephemeral signatures) — DATA AT RISK

In-place update is impossible. The uninstall wipes the database, so the backup
must come **before** anything else.

1. **Back up first.** In the old app: Settings → Backup → export the backup
   file (format v3 includes patient images) and copy it off the device (share
   sheet → Drive/email/cable), or use the configured Google Drive backup.
   Verify the export exists and opens (file size sanity check) before step 2.
2. Note the installed version (Android Settings → Apps → Dental Canvas) for
   the audit trail.
3. **Uninstall** the app.
4. Install the current APK:
   `https://github.com/azshifat007/Dental-Canvas/releases/latest` →
   `app-universal-release.apk` (enable "install unknown apps" for the browser
   / file manager when prompted).
5. Launch, then Settings → Backup → restore the file from step 1.
6. Verify: patient count matches pre-uninstall, latest appointment visible.
   From here on the app is on the stable signing key and future APKs install
   over it without uninstalling.

If the device is lost/broken before a backup was taken, the data is not
recoverable from the APK ecosystem — restore the most recent Drive backup or
a desktop folder auto-backup instead.

### D. Android, on ≥ v1.4.15

Not stuck. Download the current `app-universal-release.apk` and install it
over the existing app — signatures match (same stable key), data is preserved.
No uninstall needed.

## Prevention checklist for future releases

- Desktop trust config (`pubkey`, `endpoints`) must never change; if it ever
  must, every machine below the change is stuck and needs runbook A.
- Never let CI fall back to an ephemeral Android keystore (`1980162` made the
  stable secrets required — keep it that way).
- After each release, re-run the fingerprint check above for the new APK and
  compare with the previous release's fingerprint; add the value to the table
  in this doc. Any mismatch between consecutive releases = another stuck
  generation.
- Keep `latest.json` on the latest release (the `verify-and-publish` CI gate
  already fails the run when it's missing/stale — the desktop fleet depends
  on it).
